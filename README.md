## Description

The program resembles a process scheduler with Round Robing planning
algorithm, defined in scheduler/src/schedulers by implementing the trait
Scheduler. The system is represented by a virtual uniprocessor with an abstract
time and simulates the behavior of the processes and basic syscalls (fork,
wait, exit, sleep, signal). After a syscall, the time is tracked using
remaining and the actual timeslice of the scheduler and a scheduling decision
is taken, the decision being identified using an enum (SchedulingDecision).

Testing command:
TIMESLICE=5 REMAINING=2 cargo test --bin "runner" workers -q --features="round-robin"

The folder outputs/round-robin contains tests designed for timeslice = 5 and
remaining = 2, for a round robin scheduler.

## Implementation

Scheduler @ Simple Round Robin:

ProcessInfo struct - original Process struct fields
ProcessInfo has Process trait functions implemented

RoundRobin struct - 3 vector deques for each state a process can be. The ready_q has
on front only the running process, timeslice for a process till expiring,
minimum_remaining_timeslices - decides if the process runned long enough or if it should
be replanned, init_pid starting from 0 to represent the new processes, panic_state
assures the program to not panic if the last process is the one with pid 1 and exited,
sleep_time is used when the scheduler is put in a sleep state with sleep_time =
changed_timeslice to simulate elapsed time

panic_verify and deadlock_verify are RoundRobin specific functions for code modularity

RoundRobin - next function:

The following algorithm will return a SchedulingDecision enum value from the list {Run
{pid, timeslice}, Sleep(time_units), Deadlock, Panic, Done}, each having a well defined
set of requirements. The scheduler will be tested if it meets the requirements for the
previous decisions, in the order: Panic, Deadlock, Sleep, Run, Done.

- verify if the scheduler state is valid (not deadlock or panic) or if there are process
to plan
- add sleep_time for each waiting or sleeping process (if the scheduler was in a sleep
state, then it was no ready process, so it should not count there. If it wasn't in a
sleep state, it will add only zeroes)

- check if the processes set meet the requirements for the sleep scheduling decision (no
ready process available ad the sleeping queue will always contain at least one element
since we've already check deadlock). Iterate through sleeping processes and choose the
one with the minimum sleeping time (for efficiency) and schedule a sleep of that value,
after decresing all sleep_time fields of sleeping processes with min_sleep_time. Also,
the timeslice will be changed to min_sleep_time.
- plan the first ready process from front to back in the queue
- decide to close the program

At each - point, if the requirements are met, then the next - points will not be
accessible (every - from the RoundRobin next function has a returning point if the code
is executed there).

Some process states are changed after updating elapsed slept time or as a logic artifice
to reduce the number of code lines.

iter_mut() used over processes vectors to have the possibility to modify processes fields
in the loop retain() used to filter the sleep_q elements

clone() used when moving a sleeping process to ready queue because no multiple mutable
references of a variable are allowed in Rust

NonZeroUsize::new(val) used for generating a NonZeroUsize for Sleep scheduling decision

RoundRobin - stop function:

It is called by the processor when a running process expires on the current scheduler
timeslice or when the running process executes a syscall. It is based on the following
algorithm:

- find the reason StopReason using a match (syscall or expired timeslice)
Case 1: reason is a syscall
    - the elapsed time is evidently the current scheduler timeslice minus remaining
    - simulate time for every process and change the states if necessary
    - the current running process will increase the execution time by the
elapsed time, syscall time by 1 and other process will have the total time increased
by elapsed time value
    - reset the timeslice to the default value (initial timeslice at the RoundRobin
instantiation) and the slept_time variable of the scheduler to 0
    - syscall cases (return success, NoRunningProcess or failure):
        - fork: new process generated by the running process and added at the back
        of the ready_q. Plan the next ready process or the current if the condition
        with remaining >= min_remaining_timeslice is met => returns a pid
        - wait: move the running process to the waiting queue, changing its state
        in the waiting for the parameter event
        - sleep: the current process has to sleep time_param time, changing the
process sleep_time, using ProcessState::Waiting{ event: None }
        - signal: moves all process that are waiting for the signal_param to the
ready_q queue
        - exit: removes a process from the processes set
        In the syscall cases, timeslice changes can occur, depending on the condition
with min_remaining_timeslice.

Case 2: reason is expired process
    - elapsed time is now equal to current RoundRobin timeslice
    - consider planning the next process on the ready_q or planning itself

Implementation details:
match used to identify which syscall the process wants to execute
the value of the timeslice of time NonZeroUsize is accessed via get() method
conversion of usize to i32 to perform safe usize substractions

RoundRobin - list function:

Used by the processor when checking the state of processes and its fields

All process of type ProcessInfo from ready_q, sleep_q, wait_q are merged into a VecDeque
of type &dyn crate::Process which ProcessInfo implements it. Since the order of the
displayed process should be increasingly by pid, sort_by_key(|p| p.pid()) method is used
on the merged VecDeque.
